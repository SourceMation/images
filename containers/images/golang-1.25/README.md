# Golang 1.25 packaged by SourceMation

Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by
Google. Its simplicity, performance, and robust concurrency features make it perfect for
creating scalable and high-performance applications.

This Golang distribution is packaged from fresh official Google releases by the
SourceMation automation team. The version is 1.25.X and receives regular updates
to the latest patch version. For developer convenience, the complete `go` toolchain is
pre-installed and ready to use.

The base image is the most recent, at the time of the build,
`sourcemation/debian-13-slim` image. This provides you with a fully independent and
self-contained Golang environment, that is consistently updated and patched.
Additionally, the build process leverages cryptographic signatures to ensure
that the source code remains untampered.

## Go 1.25 new features

Go 1.25 introduces several significant improvements and new features that enhance developer productivity and application performance:

- **New Garbage Collector**: Features an improved garbage collector with better latency characteristics and reduced
  pause times, making it more suitable for latency-sensitive applications.
- **New Packages**: Introduces new standard library packages including enhanced cryptographic utilities and improved
  networking capabilities.
- **Performance Improvements**: General performance enhancements across the runtime, with particular improvements in
  memory allocation and concurrent operations.
- **Toolchain Updates**: Enhanced `go` command with better module management and improved build performance.

These updates make Go 1.25 an excellent choice for modern cloud-native applications, microservices, and high-performance
systems.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with the Golang version check:

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/golang-1.25:latest go version
```

To run the shell in the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/golang-1.25:latest /bin/bash
```

### Advanced usage examples

Run a simple "Hello, World!" Go program from the current directory, with the
port 8080 forwarded:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "${PWD}:/app" -w "/app" -it sourcemation/golang-1.25:latest sh -c 'go run main.go'
```

Build a Go binary from the current directory and run it, this time with podman:

```bash
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "${PWD}:/app" -w "/app" -it sourcemation/golang-1.25:latest sh -c 'go build -o myapp && ./myapp'
```

## Most important environment variables

This image uses the following environment variables:

```
PATH=/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
GOPATH=/go
GOLANG_VERSION=1.25.X # example: 1.25.1
GOTOOLCHAIN=local
```

## Ports

This image does not expose any ports. However, you can expose the ports you
need by using the `-p` option, setting up the ports manually, or with
kubernetes or docker-compose. You can also create an image with the ports
exposed by default.
