# Keycloak Container on Debian 12 Slim packed by SourceMation

This image, `sourcemation/keycloak`, is built on a minimal Debian base to provide a robust **Keycloak** environment. It's designed for adding authentication to applications and securing services with minimal effort, providing a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. The image integrates the complete Keycloak server and can be configured for production workloads.

Maintained by the SourceMation automation team, this Keycloak distribution is regularly updated to ensure it's current, secure, and compact. It's built on a minimal Debian Slim base, and cryptographic signatures are used during the build process to guarantee the integrity of all source code and packages.

## Core Features

  * **Identity and Access Management:** Comes with the full Keycloak server for managing users, roles, and permissions.
  * **Standard Protocol Support:** Out-of-the-box support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0.
 * **Centralized Administration:** Provides an easy-to-use web-based console for managing all aspects of the server.

-----

## Operational Use

This image is intended for production environments where centralized authentication and authorization are critical. To start the server for the first time, you must provide an initial admin username and password.

**Example for a local, non-production test:**

```bash
docker run \
    -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \
    -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -it sourcemation/keycloak
```

This command runs the Keycloak container in development mode, mapping port `8080` on your local machine to the container's default port `8080`.

## Key Environment Variables

This container uses the following environment variables for configuration. For any variable ending in `_PASSWORD`, `_USER`, etc., you can also use a `_FILE` suffix (e.g., `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE`) to provide the value from a file, which is recommended for sensitive data.

### Admin User
* `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN`: The username for the initial admin user created on the first run.
    * Default: `admin`
* `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password for the initial admin user.
    * Default: A random 24-character password will be generated and printed to the container logs on first run.

### Database Connection
* `KEYCLOAK_JDBC_DRIVER`: The JDBC driver for the database connection. For PostgreSQL, the value is `postgresql`.
* `KEYCLOAK_DATABASE_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server.
* `KEYCLOAK_DATABASE_PORT`: The port number of the PostgreSQL database server.
* `KEYCLOAK_DATABASE_NAME`: The name of the database Keycloak will connect to.
* `KEYCLOAK_DATABASE_USER`: The username for the database connection.
* `KEYCLOAK_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.

### HTTP & Server Configuration
* `KEYCLOAK_PRODUCTION`: Set to `true` to run Keycloak with the production `start` command. If `false` or unset, it will use the `start-dev` command.
    * Default: `false`
* `KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS`: A space-separated list of additional command-line arguments that will be appended to the server's startup command (e.g., `kc.sh start-dev`).
    * Example: `"--log-level=DEBUG --features=token-exchange"`

## Port Exposure
The standard Keycloak port, **8080** and **8443**, are exposed by default.
