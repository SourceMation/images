# RabbitMQ-Cluster-Operator packaged by SourceMation

RabbitMQ is a high-performant, scalable message broker for AMQP clients.

This container image provides the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator, a Kubernetes operator that automates the deployment and management of RabbitMQ clusters on Kubernetes.  

## Usage

Run a temporary container with the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator

```
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/rabbitmq-cluster-operator:latest
```

## Environment Vars, Ports, Volumes

This image uses the following environment variables:

```
APP_NAME="rabbitmq-cluster-operator"
APP_VERSION="2.16.1"
HOME=/home/rabbitmq-cluster-operator
```

This image does not expose any ports. However, you can expose the ports you need by using the `-p` option, setting up the ports manually, or with kubernetes or docker-compose. You can also create an image with the ports exposed by default.
