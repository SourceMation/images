# MariaDB packaged by SourceMation

> MariaDB is a popular open source relational database that was created by the original developers of MySQL. MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data.

This MariaDB distribution is provided by the upstream MariaDB packaging team.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with MariaDB

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/mariadb
```

### Advanced usage examples

#### Run MariaDB with custom root password

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-server \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d sourcemation/mariadb
```

#### Run MariaDB with custom database and user

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-server \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
  -e MARIADB_DATABASE=myapp \
  -e MARIADB_USER=myuser \
  -e MARIADB_PASSWORD=mypass \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d sourcemation/mariadb
```

#### Run with persistent data volume

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-server \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
  -v mariadb-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d sourcemation/mariadb
```

#### Run with initialization scripts

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-server \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
  -v /path/to/init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro \
  -v mariadb-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -d sourcemation/mariadb
```

## Extra notes

### Initialization Scripts

The container supports initialization scripts that will be executed when the database is first created. Place your scripts in the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory:

- `*.sh` files will be executed as shell scripts
- `*.sql` files will be executed as SQL scripts
- `*.sql.gz` and `*.sql.xz` files will be decompressed and executed as SQL scripts

### Security Considerations

- The container runs as the `mysql` user (non-root) for improved security
- Anonymous users are removed during initialization
- Remote root access is disabled by default (root can only connect from localhost)
- The test database is removed during initialization
