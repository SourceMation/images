# Kong Community Edition packaged by SourceMation

This image uses the official Kong Community Edition package and deploys it on
Rocky Linux 9. The following changes were made to the original image:

- Unsupported by OCI `HEALTHCHECK` instruction was removed from the Dockerfile.
- Kong is started with the `start` command instead of `docker-start`

## Usage

Deploying Kong requires multiple steps. Please use the official documentation.
You can safely skip the license part as this is the community edition.

- [Kong installation on Kubernetes](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.7.x/install/kubernetes/)
- [Kong installation on Docker](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.7.x/install/docker/)

documentation with `sourcemation/kong:latest`.

## Extra notes

- Problem with docker-start -> [GitHub
  Issue](https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/issues/224)
- `HEALTHCHECK` is not part of OCI but still mentioned as optional in official
  specs -> [GitHub Issue with
discussion](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/issues/749)
- Instead of `HEALTHCHECK`,  startup, readiness, and liveness probes should be
  used in Kubernetes -> [Kubernetes
Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
- Both the upstream Kong developers and the Rocky Linux developers do **not**
  support these images. They are built for SourceMation.
