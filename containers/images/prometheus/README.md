# Prometheus packaged by SourceMation

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database that collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

This Prometheus distribution is provided by the SourceMation packaging team, built on a secure Debian 12 Slim base image with version 3.5.0.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with Prometheus:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 9090:9090 sourcemation/prometheus:latest
```

The Prometheus web interface will be available at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

### Advanced usage examples

Run Prometheus with persistent storage:

```bash
docker run -d --name prometheus \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/prometheus \
  sourcemation/prometheus:latest
```

Run with custom configuration file:

```bash
docker run -d --name prometheus \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /path/to/your/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/prometheus \
  sourcemation/prometheus:latest
```

Run with additional command line arguments:

```bash
docker run -d --name prometheus \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/prometheus \
  sourcemation/prometheus:latest \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus \
  --web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries \
  --web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.time=15d \
  --web.enable-lifecycle
```
