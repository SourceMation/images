# Apache Camel-K packaged by SourceMation

Camel-K is an Integration Toolkit for Apache Camel aimed to increase the
scope of Camel components and patterns, like Camel DSL, for Kubernetes
integration scenarios, mainly serverless and microservice-based ones.

This Camel-K distribution is a proprietary compilation provided by the
[SourceMation](https://sourcemation.com) packaging team.

## Usage

Let's run a temporary container with Camel-K. Log in to your cluster first
(with `kubectl` or `oc`), then run the following:

```
$ echo 'from('timer:tick?period=3000')
  .setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K')
  .to('log:info')' > helloworld.groovy

$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/your-project" -w "/your-project" -it sourcemation/camel-k:latest kamel run helloworld.groovy
```
