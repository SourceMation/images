# WordPress packaged by SourceMation

> WordPress is the world's most popular content management system (CMS), built on PHP and MySQL/MariaDB.

This WordPress distribution is provided by the upstream WordPress packaging team.

## Usage

Running WordPress requires a separate database container. The following steps show how to run both the WordPress and database containers and connect them using a shared Docker network.

### Step 1: Create a Docker Network

This command creates a dedicated network that allows the WordPress and database containers to communicate with each other by name.
```bash
docker network create wordpress-net
```

### Step 2: Start the Database Container

```bash
docker run -d --name wordpress-db \
  --network wordpress-net \
  -v db_data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -e MARIADB_DATABASE=wordpress \
  -e MARIADB_USER=wordpress \
  -e MARIADB_PASSWORD=wordpress \
  sourcemation/mariadb
```

### Step 3: Start the WordPress Container

Now, run your WordPress image, connecting it to the same network and pointing it to the database container using its name (`wordpress-db`) as the host.

```bash
docker run -d --name wordpress-app \
  --network wordpress-net \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v wp_files:/var/www/html \
  -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=wordpress-db \
  -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress \
  -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress \
  -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress \
  sourcemation/wordpress
```

### Step 4: Complete the Installation in the Browser

After a minute, your WordPress site will be available at **http://localhost:8080**. You can now open this address in your web browser to complete the installation (setting your site title, admin user, etc.).
