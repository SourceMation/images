# Matomo packaged by SourceMation

> Matomo is a free and open-source web analytics application. It provides detailed reports on your website and its visitors, including the search engines and keywords they used, the language they speak, which pages they like, the files they download and so much more.

This Matomo distribution is provided by the upstream Matomo packaging team.

## Usage

Running Matomo requires a separate database container (e.g., MariaDB or MySQL). The following steps show how to run both containers and connect them using a shared Docker network.

### Step 1: Create a Docker Network

This creates a dedicated network that allows the Matomo and database containers to communicate with each other by name.

```bash
docker network create matomo-net
```

### Step 2: Start the Database Container

Run a MariaDB container on the network, creating the database and user that Matomo will need.

```bash
docker run -d --name matomo-db \
  --network matomo-net \
  -v db_data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -e MARIADB_DATABASE=matomo \
  -e MARIADB_USER=matomo \
  -e MARIADB_PASSWORD=matomo \
  sourcemation/mariadb
```

### Step 3: Start the Matomo Container

Now, run your Matomo image, connecting it to the same network and pointing it to the database container. You must also provide initial credentials for the Matomo superuser.

```bash
docker run -d --name matomo-app \
  --network matomo-net \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v matomo_files:/var/www/html \
  sourcemation/matomo
```

After a minute, your Matomo instance will be fully installed and available at **http://localhost:8080**. You can log in with the admin credentials you provided.
