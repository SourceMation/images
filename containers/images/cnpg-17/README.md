# Cloud Native PostgreSQL 17 on Debian Slim packaged by SourceMation (cnpg-17)

This image, `sourcemation/cnpg-17`, is built upon `sourcemation/postgres-17`
and extends it to provide a PostgreSQL 17 environment optimized for Cloud
Native PostgreSQL (CNPG) deployments. It includes essential extensions and
configurations for CNPG, such as `pgaudit`, `pgvector`, and
`pg-failover-slots`.

This PostgreSQL distribution is built by the SourceMation automation team. The
version is 17.X.Y and it's regularly updated. The base image is the latest
`sourcemation/debian-12-slim` image at the time of the build, providing a
small, secure, and up-to-date foundation. The build process incorporates
cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity of the source code and
packages.

## Key Features

* **Based on `sourcemation/postgres-17`:** Inherits all the benefits and security features of the base image.
* **CNPG Optimized:** Includes pre-installed extensions commonly used with Cloud Native PostgreSQL.
    * `postgresql-17-pgaudit`: Provides detailed audit logging.
    * `postgresql-17-pgvector`: Enables efficient storage and querying of vector embeddings.
    * `postgresql-17-pg-failover-slots`: Facilitates seamless failover in high-availability setups.
* **Barman Cloud Integration:** Includes `barman-cloud` for cloud-based backup and recovery.
* **Polish Locale:** The default locale is set to `pl_PL.UTF-8`.
* **Postgres UID:** The postgres user's UID is set to 26.

## Usage

Since this image is based on `sourcemation/postgres-17`, you can use it in the same way. However, it's primarily intended for CNPG deployments.

**Example for local testing (not recommended for production use):**

```bash
docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 sourcemation/cnpg-17:latest
```

**Using with Cloud Native PostgreSQL:**

Refer to the official Cloud Native PostgreSQL documentation for instructions on how to use custom images.

## Locale Configuration

The images support the following locales: en_US.UTF-8 (default), pl_PL.UTF-8. To
and regenerate the locale settings.


**Example Dockerfile snippet for switching to `ja_JP.UTF-8` (Japanese) locale:**

```dockerfile
FROM sourcemation/cnpg-17

# Change locale to ja_JP.UTF-8
RUN localedef -i ja_JP -c -f UTF-8 -A /usr/share/locale/locale.alias ja_JP.UTF-8; \
    sed -i -e 's/en_US/ja_JP/g' /etc/locale.gen && locale-gen
ENV LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8
```

## Most important environment variables

This image uses the following environment variables:

```bash
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
PG_MAJOR=17
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/postgresql/$PG_MAJOR/bin
PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data
PG_VERSION=17.X.Y # For example 17.4-1.pgdg120+2
GOSU_VERSION=1.17
```

You can set `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` to
customize the initial superuser and database. See the official PostgreSQL
Docker documentation for details (though this image aims to follow it closely).

## Ports

This image exposes port `5432` by default, which is the standard PostgreSQL
port.
