# NodeJS 20 with Yarn Classic packed by SourceMation

Node.js is a powerful and adaptable JavaScript runtime that's used to build all
sorts of applications, from simple command-line tools to complex conferencing
systems. Its popularity comes from its vast collection of modules and
widespread use.


This particular version of Node.js is built on the `sourcemation/debian-12-slim`
base image. It includes Node.js version 20 and Yarn Classic (version 1.22.XX).

## Usage

Run a temporary container with the NodeJS REPL (don't forget the `-it` flags).

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/nodejs-20:latest
```
