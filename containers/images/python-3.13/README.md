# Python 3.13 packaged by SourceMation

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Its simplicity,
emphasis on readability and a dozen of modules make it the perfect choice for
various work domains, ranging from web development to AI/ML.

This Python distribution is compiled from fresh sources by the SourceMation
automation team. The version is 3.13.X and it's regularly updated to the latest
patch version. For user convenience, the pip package manager is shipped as well.

The base image is the latest, at the time of the build,
sourcemation/Debian-12-slim image. It's gives you fully independent and
self-contained Python environment, that is regrulary updated and patched.
Lastly the build process takes advantage of cryptographic signatures to ensure
that the source code is not tampered with.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with the Python REPL (don't forget the `-it`
argument).

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/python-3.13:latest
```

To run the shell in the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/python-3.13:latest
```

### Advanced usage examples

Serve the contents of the current directory with Python's builtin HTTP server
with the port 8000 forwarded:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -v "${PWD}:/your-project" -w "/your-project" -it sourcemation/python-3.13:latest python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Build an MkDocs project from the current directory and serve it, this time with podman:

```bash
podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -v "${PWD}:/your-project" -w "/your-project" -it sourcemation/python-3.13:latest sh -c 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build && mkdocs serve'
```
