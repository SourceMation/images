# Redis packaged by SourceMation

Redis is a performant in-memory key-value database. Its simplicity, accompanied
by optimal data structures, contribute to the high operational speed.

This Redis distribution is provided by the downstream Rocky Linux 9 packaging
team in the version respective to that system (7.2.7). Due to licensing
changes, an up-to-date release will be provided as a separate product.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with Redis, ready to accept connections from your
localhost's `redis-cli`:

```
docker run -p 6379:6379 --rm --ulimit nofile=64000:64000 --ulimit nproc=64000:64000 -it sourcemation/redis:latest
```
