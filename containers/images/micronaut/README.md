# Micronaut CLI packaged by SourceMation

This image contains the Micronaut CLI, Java-21 GraalVM, and SDKMAN on Rocky
Linux 9. This allows you to build and run Micronaut applications using GraalVM.
Everything is installed with SDKMAN, so you can easily switch between different
versions of Java.

## Usage

First, run a container with a shell:

```
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm -it sourcemation/micronaut:latest
```

Being inside the container, create a new Micronaut application:

```
$ mn create-app example.sourcemation.testapp --build=maven --lang=java
```

Then, go to the application's directory, run tests to check if everything is OK
and build a native-image application.

```
$ cd testapp
$ ./mvnw test
$ ./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image
```

After running these commands inside your local container, run the application
with `/home/micronaut/testapp/target/testapp`. Example listing:

```
[micronaut@664a3ed677a9 testapp]$ /home/micronaut/testapp/target/testapp
