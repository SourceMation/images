# ManageIQ repacked by Sourcemation

ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform that provides a unified
view of your hybrid cloud environment. This repository contains a repacked
version of ManageIQ, tailored for easier deployment and management.

## Usage

The easiest way to start the ManageIQ appliance is to use the provided image.
To start **temporary** image with the latest version of ManageIQ, you can use the
following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:443 quay.io/sourcemation/manageiq:latest-amd64
```

The ManageIQ web interface will be available at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

#### **The default username is `admin` and the password is `smartvm`.**

## Persistence

The container has two volumes

- `/var/www/miq/vmdb`
- `/var/lib/pgsql/data`

These volumes are used to used to create a persistent storage for the ManageIQ
database and application data. You can mount these volumes to your host or a to
your kubernetes cluster to ensure that your data is not lost when the container
is stopped or removed.

Example with podman:

```bash
podman run -d --name manageiq \
  -p 8080:443 \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/var/www/miq/vmdb \
  -v /path/to/your/db:/var/lib/pgsql/data \
  quay.io/sourcemation/manageiq:radjabov-1
```

Note usage of the `radjabov-1` tag. You can use particular tag to run a specific
version of ManageIQ. The `latest` tag will always point to the latest version of
ManageIQ.
