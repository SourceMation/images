> MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

This MySQL distribution is provided by the upstream MySQL packaging team.

## Usage

## Extra notes

### Initialization Scripts

The container supports initialization scripts that will be executed when the database is first created. Place your scripts in the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory:

- `*.sh` files will be executed as shell scripts
- `*.sql` files will be executed as SQL scripts
- `*.sql.gz` and `*.sql.xz` files will be decompressed and executed as SQL scripts

### Security Considerations

- The container runs as the `mysql` user (non-root) for improved security
- Anonymous users are removed during initialization
- Remote root access is enabled but secured with password authentication
- The test database is removed during initialization
