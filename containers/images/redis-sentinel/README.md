# Redis sentinel packaged by SourceMation

Redis is a performant in-memory key-value database. Its simplicity, accompanied
by optimal data structures, contribute to the high operational speed.

Built by SourceMation's automation team, this Redis release undergoes regular
updates, following the official `stable` release. The foundation is the latest
`sourcemation/debian-12-slim` image at build time, ensuring a compact, secure,
and current setup.

## Usage

Run a temporary container with Redis, ready to accept connections from your
localhost's `redis-cli`:

```
docker run -p 26379:26379 --rm --ulimit nofile=64000:64000 --ulimit nproc=64000:64000 -it sourcemation/redis-sentinel:latest
```

## Environment Vars, Ports, Volumes

This image uses the following environment variables:

```
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
REDIS_PORT=26379
```

This image exposes the following ports:

- 26379 : the default Redis sentinel port for remote connections

Please note that the ports need to be either manually forwarded with the
`-p` option or let Docker choose some for you with the `-P` option.

## Extra notes

**The server runs as the system user and group `redis` with UID 1000 and GID
1000.** Our older images were using UID 998 and GID 998. The new (1000/1000)
user/group is more compatible with other Redis images.
