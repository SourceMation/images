# NodeJS 24 with Yarn Classic packed by SourceMation

Leveraging its cross-platform nature and scalable architecture, Node.js® serves
as a powerful JavaScript runtime, facilitating the development of a wide
spectrum of applications, from simple command-line tools to complex
conferencing solutions, all thanks to its vibrant community and extensive
collection of modules.


This particular NodeJS distribution is built upon the
`sourcemation/debian-12-slim` base image and integrates Node.js version 24
along with Yarn Classic, specifically version `1.22.XX`.


**This image is optimized for build reproducibility and contains the packages
needed to compile NodeJS, providing developers with all tools needed in more advanced
NodeJS development - thus it's not a super small image.**

## Usage

Launch a temporary container equipped with the NodeJS REPL (remember to include the -it flags).

```bash
docker run --rm -it sourcemation/nodejs-24:latest
```

docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v "${PWD}:/your-project" -w "/your-project" -it sourcemation/nodejs-24:latest npm run start
```

Deploy the contents of the current directory with your NodeJS project using
yarn.
