# GCC 13 packaged by SourceMation

This image provides the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 13. It's ready to
compile your C, C++, Fortran, and other supported languages right out
of the container.

This image is built on top of SourceMation Debian 12 Slim image:

```dockerfile
from sourcemation/debian:12-slim
(...)
```

## Usage

To run a container with GCC 13 and access a shell:

```bash
docker run -it sourcemation/gcc-13 /bin/bash
```

To compile your code, you can mount your project directory into the container:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/your/project:/app -w /app sourcemation/gcc-13 gcc main.c -o main
```

Where the `-v` flag mounts your local directory to `/app` in the container, and
`-w` sets the working directory to `/app`.


You can also create a custom Dockerfile to extend this image:

```dockerfile
FROM sourcemation/gcc-13

# Add your custom files
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN gcc main.c -o main

CMD ["./main"]
```

Then build and run your custom image:

```bash
docker build -t my-gcc-app .
docker run -it my-gcc-app
```

## Environment Vars, Ports, Volumes

This image doesn't define any specific environment variables, expose ports, or
require persistent volumes for basic usage. You can, however, mount volumes to
share your source code and build output.

There are the following variables defined in the image:

```bash
GCC_VERSION="13.3.0" # this might change depending on exact version
GPG_KEYS="B215C1633BCA0477615F1B35A5B3A004745C015A (...)" # It's set of keys that can be used to verify the GPG signature of the GCC tarball
```

This image also uses `dpkg-divert` to mask the original `gcc` and `g++`
binaries. They still exist in the system.

```
/usr/bin/gcc.orig
/usr/bin/g++.orig
/usr/bin/gfortran.orig
```
